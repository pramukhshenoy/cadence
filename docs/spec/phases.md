# Build Phases

Each sub-phase ends with the quality gate and a git commit (see `dev-workflow.md`).  
Git push follows each commit if a remote is configured.

## Phase 4 — Calendar Auto-Blocking

### 4a — Dev Build + Permissions + Calendar Selection ✅

### 5b — Sleep Backend ✅
- [x] `POST /api/sleep` — persist SleepRecord (upsert on localDate to prevent duplicates)
